For 1.0 release:
1. Test


1.1 Release:
1. Categoricial/pool based exclusions - e.g. movement, boosted, armor, etc
2. Skill default functions - e.g. isNotCyborg for Popular Hero
3. Specifying defaults for things like weight and reusublity (separate for lowest possible)
4. Hijack AddPilot to avoid searching _G for pilots?


1.2 Release:
1. Add support for multiple pilots with same ID
2. Squad inclusions/exclusions
3. Move to GetText to be consistent/allow localization
4. Add auto support of "auto-dictonarying" skill strings
	Mostly just replacing test with GetText and adding a SetText. Can probably try calling GetText to see if it exists first
5. consider using bulk reading for state capture to avoid multiple reads near each other as optimization
