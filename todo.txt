Automatically replace dll in memhack when rebuild dll
consider dll subtables - reorganize or flatten?
dll -
	rw - for read/write operations on memory address and supporting consts
	alloc - for allocating
	address - for getting addresses (base and UD), bounds, etc
	scanner
base obj (lua)
	debug - helpful for troubleshooting
		todo add a log each k & v fn as well?
	struct - struct related helpers/functions for accessing/modifying memory


Add scan for hanger
Add tests/test support (see memedit?)



---------- PLUS Ex ---------

Finish up spacing on UI
Add relationships editor to UI

Tie into game for enabling/disabling AE skills. Remove/replace AE Skills checkbox saying its unused with CPLUS+ instead?
(once added scan for hanger) update to assign skills to new pilots in hanger
Grid and reactors don't stack - make a way to stack them on skills
	Add OnLevelUp Hook/event for pilots? Tie into on save data to determine. Also tie into level up fn?
Add localization support/auto generate skill texts and such to support GetText? Is this needed?
	Doesn't seem to be but might be good to have "auto dictionary" support. Need to think on how to do this
	Mostly just replacing test with GetText and adding a SetText. Can probably try calling GetText to see if it exists first
