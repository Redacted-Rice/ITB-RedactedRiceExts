For 1.0 release:
1. Find pilots in pods and island rewards
2. Document how to find/how I found the references in memhack
	1. Score
	2. Rep
	3. pilot (in mech)
	4. storage (very complex)
5. Hijack AddPilot to avoid searching _G for pilots?
6. Add structure verification support (vtables or custom funcs)
7. Split structs out of pilot into separate classes (Maybe not the array one but at least lvl up skills itself)
8. Test added stacktrace calls, add to modloader and modutils (test events & hooks for both)

Next release:
1. Look into adding tests on c++ side?
2. Add more lua tests

---------- PLUS Ex ---------

For 1.0 release:
1. Cleanup relationship GUI and get it looking a bit nicer
	a. Collapsable frames for sections (like weapons deck)
	b. Spacing between sections
	c. drop down sizing and location
2. Check into removing/hiding/replacing text for AE skills UI checkbox
	a. Toggle_NewPilotAbilities - "Pilot Abilities"
	b. TipTitle_New_PilotAbilities	- "Advanced Pilot Abilities"
	c. TipTitle_New_PilotAbilities	- "Enable advanced pilot abilities. Pilots will gain new skills as they level up.\n\nRecommended for anyone who has a good grasp of the core game."
3. Update to assign pilot skills in storage
4. Make skill enable/active hooks and function calls


Bugs
1. Reusability not saving/restoring correctly? Seems to be working now? Can't retrigger it for some reason? Was getting nil skillId? Maybe related to extra skills no longer there?

Next release candadites:
1. Move to GetText to be consistent/allow localization
2. Add auto support of "auto-dictonarying" skill strings
	Mostly just replacing test with GetText and adding a SetText. Can probably try calling GetText to see if it exists first
3. Re-evaluate mock usage in tests. Is there a simpler way?
4. consider using bulk reading for state capture to avoid multiple reads near each other as optimization (maybe defer?)
