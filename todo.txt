Automatically replace dll in memhack when rebuild dll
consider dll subtables - reorganize or flatten?
dll -
	rw - for read/write operations on memory address and supporting consts
	alloc - for allocating
	address - for getting addresses (base and UD), bounds, etc
	scanner
base obj (lua)
	debug - helpful for troubleshooting
		todo add a log each k & v fn as well?
	struct - struct related helpers/functions for accessing/modifying memory


Add scan for hanger
Add tests/test support (see memedit?)



---------- PLUS Ex ---------

Tie into game for enabling/disabling AE skills
Add (built in) options to exclude/include skills based on other skills
Add/support exclusions defined in txt files for user additions for conflicting mods
Look into a way to autoadd config options for each added skill? Maybe if not support config file based enable/disabling?
(once added scan for hanger) update to assign skills to new pilots in hanger
