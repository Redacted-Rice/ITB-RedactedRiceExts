Automatically replace dll in memhack when rebuild dll
consider dll subtables - reorganize or flatten?
dll -
	rw - for read/write operations on memory address and supporting consts
	alloc - for allocating
	address - for getting addresses (base and UD), bounds, etc
	scanner
base obj (lua)
	debug - helpful for troubleshooting
		todo add a log each k & v fn as well?
	struct - struct related helpers/functions for accessing/modifying memory


Add scan for hanger
Add tests/test support (see memedit?)



---------- PLUS Ex ---------

Rename to PLUS Ex
Exlude current skills from randomizer
Add other specific, pilot (ID) based exclusions (Ideally generic impl not specific to pilot)
