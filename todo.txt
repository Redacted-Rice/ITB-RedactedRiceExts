Next release candadites:
	Major Features:
		1. Categoricial exclusions - e.g. movement, boosted, armor, etc
		2. Memory Analyzer to help find things
		3. Skill default functions - e.g. isNotCyborg for Popular Hero
		4. Add support for multiple pilots with same ID
		5. Squad inclusions/exclusions
		6. Skill rarities? - legendary skills & skill caps
		7. Specifying defaults for things like weight and reusublity (separate for lowest possible)

	Fixes/Enhancemnets
		1. Move to GetText to be consistent/allow localization
		2. Add auto support of "auto-dictonarying" skill strings
			Mostly just replacing test with GetText and adding a SetText. Can probably try calling GetText to see if it exists first
		3. Re-evaluate mock usage in tests. Is there a simpler way?
		4. consider using bulk reading for state capture to avoid multiple reads near each other as optimization (maybe defer?)
		5. Hijack AddPilot to avoid searching _G for pilots?
