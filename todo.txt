Automatically replace dll in memhack when rebuild dll
Add way to disable all setters/getters?
Inconsistnet capitalization of generated struct fields. Also come up with convention for non getter/setter fields
	get/set - memhack fns
	_ - "hidden" fn/read only var. Only use fns if you know what youare doing. Var should only be read
	Go back to camelCase (here and memhack.dll)
	remove getBaseAddress/setBaseAddress
	_size instead of structsize
	_getFieldAddress
Work on naming in general... Not particularly happy with things as is
	pointers -> getXxxPtr, setXxxPtr, getXxx
		setXxx, structs:set
	structs -> getXxx
		setXxx, structs:set
	"primitives" -> getXxx, setXxx
	ItBString
		getXxxStr -> ItBString:set
Auto generate to string fn & debug string
	__tostring
	toDebugString
		--auto parse through and call get on each field and map to _layout

Add tests/test support (see memedit?)
Add dynamic scanning capabilities for all accessible memory (see memedit scan/scanner)
	Include negate scans
	Include value changed scans?
