Next release candadites:
1. Move to GetText to be consistent/allow localization
2. Add auto support of "auto-dictonarying" skill strings
	Mostly just replacing test with GetText and adding a SetText. Can probably try calling GetText to see if it exists first
3. Re-evaluate mock usage in tests. Is there a simpler way?
4. consider using bulk reading for state capture to avoid multiple reads near each other as optimization (maybe defer?)
5. Skill rarities - legendary skills & skill caps
6. Squad inclusions/exclusions
7. Categoricial exclusions - e.g. movement, boosted, armor, etc
8. Add support for multiple pilots with same ID
9. Hijack AddPilot to avoid searching _G for pilots?
