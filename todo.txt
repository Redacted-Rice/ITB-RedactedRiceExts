For 1.0 release:
1. Add scan for storage in upgrade menu
	As a backup/double check, check the vtable of research control
	Breach.exe+4B4F08 -> onj + 0x18 -> Game + 0x10 -> GameMap + 0x5674 (ResearchControl) + 0x68 hanger (vector) (56DC)
		This is to head of vector. Tail is next byte
		From there offset offset by 11c (or 120) to get pilot
		Note the vector can reallocate!
	Need to investigate/handle weapons vs pilots. Check for field in wrapper struct or for vtable
		Is the x120 offset for pilot the same for weapon?
2. Restructure calls?
	consider dll subtables - reorganize or flatten?
	dll -
		rw - for read/write operations on memory address and supporting consts
		alloc - for allocating
		address - for getting addresses (base and UD), bounds, etc
		scanner
	base obj (lua)
		debug - helpful for troubleshooting
			todo add a log each k & v fn as well?
		struct - struct related helpers/functions for accessing/modifying memory
3. Look into adding tests (at least in lua?). May not be very feasible for most things
	Add tests/test support (see memedit?)
4. Document how to find/how I found the references in memhack
	1. Score
	2. Rep
	3. pilot (in mech)
	4. storage (very complex)
	

---------- PLUS Ex ---------

For 1.0 release:
1. Cleanup relationship GUI and get it looking a bit nicer
	a. Collapsable frames for sections (like weapons deck)
	b. Spacing between sections
	c. drop down sizing and location
2. Check into removing/hiding/replacing text for AE skills UI checkbox
	a. Toggle_NewPilotAbilities - "Pilot Abilities"
	b. TipTitle_New_PilotAbilities	- "Advanced Pilot Abilities"
	c. TipTitle_New_PilotAbilities	- "Enable advanced pilot abilities. Pilots will gain new skills as they level up.\n\nRecommended for anyone who has a good grasp of the core game."
3. Update to assign pilot skills in storage
4. Add OnLevelUp Hook/event for pilots? Tie into on save data to determine. Also tie into level up fn?
5. Allow grid and reactors to stack like hp and move (using 4)
	Right now only the first one with it applies
	
Next release candadites:
1. Move to GetText to be consistent/allow localization
2. Add auto support of "auto-dictonarying" skill strings
	Mostly just replacing test with GetText and adding a SetText. Can probably try calling GetText to see if it exists first
